description: >
  Offline-first positioning engine for hybrid indoor/outdoor pedestrian navigation:
  GPS smoothing (optional outdoor graph snapping), indoor PDR (step detection + step-length estimation),
  barometer-based floor change detection, corridor snapping, and deterministic trace recording + replay.
  Pure Dart core designed for reproducible experiments (e.g., Campus navigation).
